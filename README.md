A general wallpaper repository put together
by goofyfox. It will be committed to whenever
he finds a new wallpaper that he likes.

Goofyfox is not responsible for their use and has not currently created any of these images. 
Credit for images goes to their respected original authors.
Would recommend only using them for wallpapers
or any personal projects,
as tracing them back to their original owners and licenses would take more time
than goofyfox is willing to put in.
